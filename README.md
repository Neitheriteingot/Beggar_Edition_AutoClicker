# Beggar Edition Auto Clicker For Windows 

## What's "Beggar Edition"?
This is a "beggar edition" auto-clicker - stripped down to the absolute essentials, with no fancy features or bloated code. Just pure, lightweight auto-clicking functionality for those who need something simple and effective.

## Core Features
An ultra-lightweight auto-clicking tool that enables automatic continuous left-clicking of the mouse, with support for custom delay time. True to its "beggar edition" philosophy, it focuses solely on what matters.

## Key Traits
- **Fast Response**: Built on Windows API for efficient click execution. No bloat, just instant startup and operation.
- **Minimal Code**: Core functionality in just 80+ lines of code. No unnecessary modules or complicated logic.
- **No-Nonsense Operation**: All controls via hotkeys - no menus, no settings windows, no hassle.

## Operation Instructions
- **F8 Key**: Toggle auto-clicking state (works in any window)
- **F10 Key**: Set click delay (use when console is focused; minimum 10ms)
- **ESC Key**: Exit program (use when console is focused)

## Working Mechanism
When enabled, the program performs automatic left-clicks at the current mouse position, using your set delay time (default 500ms). It runs in a loop until disabled or closed - simple, reliable, and true to its "beggar edition" promise.
